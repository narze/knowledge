# Teaching

## My rule of thumb on teaching \(especially on coding subjects\)

* Use less technical terms as possible. Explain every technical terms you have mentioned \(eg. array, object, function, etc.\) or don't use that term.
* Explain why you should to this instead of that.
* Teach with real-life examples & use cases, plain simple web server always win OOP principles.
* Less startup time \(Setting up Ruby vs PHP w/ LAMP\)
* Go slow, everyone has different paces.
* Make it fun!

## What I've been teaching

* Hardware coding on Arduino
* 3D-Modelling & Printing with Sketchup & Slicer
* Ruby with simple web server \(Sinatra\)
* Speed Reading
