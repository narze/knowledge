# macOS

I've been using macOS for a bit more than 10 years now \(since [Snow Leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard) maybe\) It has so many apps & tools which is very useful and some not available in any other platforms. I have a MacBook Pro from my work and a machine with Hackintosh installed.

I maintain my apps on both machines with [my laptop script](https://github.com/narze/laptop).

## Apps

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) \(Free/Paid\)

Spotlight replacement, with [many useful workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) \([Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) required.\)

### [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) \(Paid\)

API & programming languages documentation browser. Saves me quite some time googling. Works offline.

### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) \(Free/Donation\)

A better terminal. The latest version \([3.3](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_3_0.changelog)\) also introduce Python API so it should have many useful plugins in the future.

### [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/) \(Free/Donation\)

I apply my Pomodoro Technique with this app. What I like is it can block your whole screen with an overlay which is customizable.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \(Open Source\)

My code editor of choice, I switched from [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for quite some time now. Speed is not better but good enough.
