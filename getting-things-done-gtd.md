# Getting Things Done \(GTD\)

I follow GTD practice to manage my tasks. I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) as an inbox to maintain everything that comes to me.

Before this I used to apply [Evernote](http://evernote.com) with GTD setup called [TSW](https://thesecretweapon.org/).
