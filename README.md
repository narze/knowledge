# Introduction

Welcome to my wiki, which I'll try to share everything I've learned.

## Why Wiki?

It's quite fun taking notes on everything you learn. Apparently there are a few people doing this as well, check it out [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge). You can start one yourself using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) like mine.
