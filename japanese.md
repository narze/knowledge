# Japanese

I use [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com) to learn Japanese using [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) method. By the way the app doesn't help me about writing part. I bought [Minna no Nihongo](http://www.3anet.co.jp/english/books/books_01.html) series to practice writing Japanese alphabets. For Kanji [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) should help but I didn't tried that yet.
