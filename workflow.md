# Workflow

After using \(and rebooting\) [GTD](getting-things-done-gtd.md) a bunch of times I decided to make my own workflow from methods which are working for me. The workflow including multiple abstractions and apps :

* Collect & brain dump into "Inbox" \([GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)\) 
* [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero)
* [Systemist](https://doist.com/blog/systemist-personal-workflow) from Todoist \(Also GTD but simplified\)
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) for task management & todo list
* Pomodoro Method using [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/)
* Time tracking using [Timing](http://timingapp.com/)

The list grows or shrinks from time to time as I find or quit using some apps.
